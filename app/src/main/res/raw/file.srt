不能光为了满足私欲

她说我都不清楚我自己正在做什么

- 我可不是诗人   - 那就给她唱情歌

让我为你画幅画吧？
Let me paint you!

66
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,230
为什么？

在森林里吧，我们小时候一起玩的地方

在水边嬉戏...裸体的

72
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,332
娜塔奥卡！求你，让我画吧

73
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:20,505
<i>我们说的是向她示爱！这就是你的方式？</i>

74
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,527
娜塔奥卡，跟我们走吧
Natalka, come with us.

75
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,320
去基辅
Come to Kiev.

76
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,121
- 离开村子？   - 对
- Leave the village?   - Yes.

77
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,792
我有个叔叔，叫约瑟夫，他可以在工厂里帮尤里找份工作
I have an uncle, Josef, and he can get Yuri a job at the factory.

78
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,753

那是我们的希望，娜塔奥卡

这才是重点
That's all that matters.

84

不要有过多奢求
Don't make more of this than what it is.

85
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,407
不会的
Of course not.

86
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,286
- 我只想让你明白...   - 我不在乎
- I just need you to understand-   - I don't care.

87
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,750
你的父母是否结婚对我而言有何区别
What difference does it make to me whether your parents are married or not.

88
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,670
你觉得你不在乎，但你会的！
You think you don't, but you will!

89
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,090
你无法理解不被别人接受是什么感觉
You don't understand what it's like to not be accepted by others,

90
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,512
还有邻居们看你的眼神
judged by your neighbours.

91
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:51,512
当你能够选择的时候为什么要去找麻烦？
Why seek that trouble if you have a choice?

92
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,056
选择？
Choice?

93

- 你认为我还有选择？   - 不！别激动！
- You think I have a choice?   - No! Don't start!

不，自从我第一眼见到你开始，我就没得选择
No, I haven't had a choice about how I felt since the moment I saw you.

95
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,274
你明白现实吗？
Do you understand the real world?

96
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,359
是，我明白！
Yes I do!

97
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,321
我们可以共同面对
We can face it together.

98
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,594
你在今晚的庆典中向上帝祈祷时...你会看到的！

99
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,141
我们彼此心属对方
We belong together.

100
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,035
我应该嫁给他吗？
Will I ever marry'?

101
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,515
你不该爱上我
You shouldn't love me.

102
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,270
我只会给你带来不幸
I only bring you misfortune.

103
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,231
哦，我一直是只关心琐碎小事的傻瓜
Oh, I have been a fool for lesser things.

104
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,861
不要离开我，娜塔奥卡
Don't run away from me, Natalka.

105
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,198
嫁给我吧！
Marry me!

106
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,204
可是，斯大林同志，列宁同志想实行集体化
But, Comrade Stalin, Comrade Lenin tried to collectivise.

107
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,707
他的对象是知识分子，教堂，农民
He targeted the intelligentsia, the church, the peasants.

108
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,501
乌克兰人反叛了
The Ukrainians rebelled.

109
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,128
- 他们十分活跃！   - 列宁太仁慈了
- They flourished!   - Lenin was too lenient.

110
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,631
梅毒令他意志软弱
Syphilis had softened his brain.

111
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,051
<i>要给乌克兰上上课来服从我们的意志</i>
<i>Ukraine must be taught to bow to our will.</i>

112
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,305
<i>没有那里丰富的矿产和粮食资源</i>

113
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,599
<i>俄罗斯就无法生存</i>
<i>Russia cannot exist.</i>

114
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,477
那么，科巴，你觉得我们该怎么着手？
So, <i>Koba, how do you propose we proceed?</i>

115
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,230
我们贯彻列宁的计划
We implement Lenin's plan,

116
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,399
<i>但不能留情</i>
<i>but without mercy.</i>

117
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,762
上帝保佑你
God bless you.

118
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,033
别再祷告了，牧师。我们得谈谈
Finish your prayer, priest. We need to talk.

119
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,289
告诉我：教堂里的金银藏在哪儿？
Tell me: Where is the churches gold and silver?

120
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,587
你认为那些农民需要这些东西去崇拜他们的神？
You think these peasants need all these material objects to worship their god?

121
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,426
挂在那儿的东西有什么价值？
And what object of value hung there?

122
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,557
神像在哪？
Where is the icon?

123
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,230
- 迪米特里！   - 是！
- Dimitri!   - Sir!

124
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,152
我会回来的
I will return.

125
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,699
同时...我建议你向你的神祷告吧
In the meantime... I suggest you pray to your god.

126
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,912
那对你没什么用
Not that it'll do you any good.

127
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,175
让你尝尝！
Take this!

128
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,888
他们来了

- Do as your grandfather says.   - GO, Yuri, go!

132
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,732
尤里，去敲警钟。快去！
Yuri, raise the alarm. GO!

133
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,636
我是政委谢尔盖·库佐夫
I am Commissar Sergei Koltsov.

134
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,139
你是博伊卡？
You are Boyko?

135
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,437
我能看到，博伊卡，你有一匹马...
I see, Boyko, you own a horse...

136
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,314
一头奶牛...

137
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,025
田地
land.

138
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,780
你是不是雇人来种田？
Do you hire help to manage the land?

139
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,161
那你就是富农
Then you are <i>kulak.</i>

140
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,246
是特权阶级，国家的敌人
A privileged class, an enemy of the state.

141
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,958
该死的！该死的吸血鬼
Bastards! Blo0d-sucking bastards.

142
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,836
我只是个可怜的农民
I am a poor peasant.

143
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,671
这由国家来决定
That's for the state to decide.

144
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,674
要是肯配合，可以允许你住在合作社里
If you cooperate, you'll be allowed t0 live in the cooperative.

145
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,468

You mean on my own land?

146
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,512
要是不配合，你要么会进监狱...
If you don't, you'll either be jailed...

147
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,182
要么枪决
or shot.

148
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,810
国家什么时候决定？
When will the state decide?

149
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,645
已经决定了
It already has.

150
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,316
你日落前离开
You leave at sundown.

151
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,778
否则，你会因擅闯国有土地被捕
If not, you'll be arrested for trespassing on state land.

152
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,239
你准备拿他怎么办？
What do you want with this man'?

153
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,616
他是国家的敌人
He's an enemy of the state.

154
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,868
敌人？这是胡说八道
An enemy? That's nonsense.

155
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,205
兄弟，你和你家人可以来我家住
Brother, you and your family are welcome to stay with us.

156
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,457
- 你是谁？   - 自由的人！
- And who are you?   - Free men!

157
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,094
追上他们！
After them!

158
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,187
爸爸！
Papa!

159
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,886
没人...没人能剥夺你的自由！
No one... no one can ever take away your freedom!

160
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,929
记住
Remember that.

161
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,932
上帝与你同在，我的孩子
God be with you, my son.

162
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,683
你见过那个老头吗？
Have you seen the old man?

163
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,727
我听说他还活着
I hear he's still alive.

164
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,855
别跟我撒谎，牧师！
Don't lie to my, priest!

165
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,400
- 这是罪过！   - 我们都是罪人
- It's a sin!   - We're all sinners.

166
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,402
那你有祷告吗，同志？
Then you've been praying, comrade?

167
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,572
- 每天都有   - 是你的上帝画了那幅神像？
- Every day.   - And has your God produced the icon?

168
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,115
不，不是他
No, he has not.

169
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,992
知道为什么吗？
Do you know why?

170
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,286
因为根本就没有上帝
Because there is no God.

171
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,622
没有邪恶，没有罪过，没有地狱
No evil, no sin, no hell.

172
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,627
统统都是幻想
It's all a delusion.

173
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,506
没有仁爱之心才是地狱！
Hell is the inability to love!

174
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,853
这是最后一个了
This is the last of it.

175
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,649
同志，我们会从明早开始建牢房
Comrade, we'll start building the cells in the morning.

176
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,326
够了！粮食够了
Enough! That's enough grain.

177
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,539
我们准备走了
We're moving out.

178
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:52,352
我爱你！出来吧我想见你！
I love you! Show yourself I want to see you!

179
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,397
出来吧！我想见你！
Come out! I want to see you!

180
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:01,862
- 娜塔奥卡！我的娜塔奥卡！   - 别！
- Natalka! My Natalka!   - Don't!

181
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,700
不，不...我爱你！跟我走吧...求你！
NO, no... I love you! Come with me... please!

182
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,993
塔拉斯，你喝醉了
Taras, you're drunk.

183
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,413
- 请你知道，我爱你！   - 别这样！
- Please! I love you!   - Stop it!

184
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,081
塔拉斯！她要嫁给尤里了！
Taras! She's marrying Yuri!

185
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,255
你去哪？
Where are you going?

186
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,467
我去见见朋友们，在他们去基辅之前
I'm going to see our friends before they leave for Kiev.

187
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,720
你的朋友都是胆小鬼
Your friends are cowards.

188
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,683
他们以为可以用音乐去打仗
They think they can fight battles, using music.

189
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,101
或是文章
And words.

190
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,605
尤里也很努力的
Yuri tried to help.

191
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,817
- 他正努力像你那样   - 他不像我！
- He's trying to be more like you.   - He's not like me!

192
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,320
而且一点也不像他父亲
And he's nothing like his father.

193
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,208
请进，来吧，尤里
Please! Come, Yuri.

194
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,002
我叔叔能给你找到活干
My uncle can get you work.

195
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,296
瞧！国家正召集艺术家
Look! The state is inviting artists.

196
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,176
我不能走。至少现在不行
I can't leave. Not now.

197
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,179
要等娜塔奥卡的妈妈身体复原
Not until Natalka's mother recovers.

198
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,266
我们会去的...等她好些了
We'll come... as soon as she's better.

199
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,942
我会尽快跟你们汇合
I'll join you as soon as I can.

200
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,365
再见
Good bye.

201
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,328
照顾好自己
Look after yourself.

202
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,046
<i>除非我们能够阻止我们的经济倒退</i>
<i>Unless we end our economic backwardness,</i>

203
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,424
<i>否则我们西方的敌人会把我们摧毁</i>
<i>our enemies in the west will destroy us.</i>

204
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:32,888
每个男人、女人和儿童都要尽责去供养工人
Every man, woman and child must do their duty to feed the workers.

205
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,230
粮食收入要更多地交给国家
Have the state requisition more of the harvest,

206
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,851
要必要的话要达到90%
up to 90% if necessary.

207
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:42,105
可是，斯大林同志，那对农民来说就相当于死刑
But, Comrade Stalin, that will be a death sentence for the farmers.

208
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,316
这是革命的需要！
The revolution depends on it!

209
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,777
想想大局吧
Think of the greater good.

210
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,405
也许他是对的，科巴
He's probably right, Koba.

211
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,366
这意味着数百万人命
This could mean the death of millions.

212
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,037
可谁会知道呢？
Who in the world will know?

213
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,208
<i>偷盗粮食的人都已受到正义的惩罚</i>
<i>Those caught stealing grain have received justice.</i>

214
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,336
但是这个村子的集体农庄已经失败
But the collective of this village has failed.

215
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,671
你们没有完成粮食限额
You did not meet your grain quota.

216
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:10,050
斯大林同志因此下令提高额度
Consequently, Comrade Stalin has ordered an increase.

217
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:14,179
整个乌克兰一视同仁。今年你们必须提高一倍产量
All over Ukraine it's the same. You must double production this year,

218
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,389
否则你们就有好果子吃
or you will suffer the consequences.

219
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,725
庄稼大部分都被天气毁掉了
Much of the harvest was lost to weather.

220
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,269
- 也许是被偷了？   - 你胡说！
- Or stolen?   - That's a lie!

221
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,313
我们没有足够的马来耕地
We don't have enough horses to plough the fields.

222
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,482
为什么，同志？
Why is that, comrade?

223
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,500
我们不得不把它们吃了！
We had to eat them!

224
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,860
这就是为什么斯大林同志给你们带来了拖们机
That is why Comrade Stalin brought you tractors,

225
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,155
机械化意味着你们必须尽责
modern mechanical means to meet your responsibilities.

226
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,908
而你们却通过盗窃国家财产来报答他？
And you repay him by stealing from the state?

227
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,786
<i>这就是我所说的：忘恩负义</i>
<i>That's what</i> I call <i>ingratitude</i>.

228
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,747
我们知道你们把粮食藏起来了
We know you're hiding grain.

229
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,085
签字！
Sign!

230
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,254
加入集体农庄
Join the collective.

231
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,631
会活得更好
Life will be much better.

232
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,808
从教堂没收的财产总值没达到我们的预期啊
Our seizure of church property has not been as lucrative as we hoped.

233
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:04,104
除去镇压外，集体化进程也很缓慢
Despite the crackdown, collectivisation is still slow.

234
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:08,275
我已经开始把富农领袖们送去西伯利亚
<i>I've already started shipping the kulak leaders to Siberia,</i>

235
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,278
但是抵抗仍很强烈，而且在蔓延
but resistance is strong and spreading.

236
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,281
如果不加制止，我们会失去乌克兰
If we do not stop it, we could lose Ukraine.

237
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,534
他们有很多想法，却不知道只有一条路可走
They think they have choices when they have only one.

238
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,329
<i>逼迫他们，打击他们！</i>
<i>Push them, crush them!</i>

239
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,982
粮食在哪？在哪？
Where is the grain? Where is it?

240
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,156
- 你想让我签这个字？   - 土地属于国家
- You want me to sign this?   - The land belongs t0 the state.

241
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:05,332
你，你的神像，你的田...
You, your icon, your land...

242
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,126
现在统统属于国家
all belong to the state now.

243
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,570
给，把刀拿着
Here, take the knife.

244
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,074
是爸爸的
It was father's.

245
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,203
你是时候离开了
It's time for you to leave.

246
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,221
在你走之前，我要你拿好
Before you leave, I want you to hold

247
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,182
我们村子古老而神圣的精神
the ancient and holy spirit of our village.

248
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,896
圣尤里的神像
The icon of Saint Yuri.

249
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,065
我们信念的象征
The symbol of our faith.

250
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,779
而这个...是父亲的梦想
And here... a father's dream.

251
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:26,997
就算我死了...他仍会活在世间
Had I gone... he would still be alive.

252
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,958
去基辅吧！
GO to Kiev!

253
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,878
去做你一直梦想的画家
GO and become the artist you've always dreamed of being.

254
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,383
你父亲也会如此期待
It's what your father would have wanted.

255
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,240
抱紧我...
Hold me...

256
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,535
能多久就多久！
as long as you can!

257
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,914
快点。上了火车我们可以想怎么做就怎么做
Come on. We can do this on the train all you like.

258
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,544
我不去了
I'm not coming.

259
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,548
什么？
What?

260
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,467
还没到时候
Not yet.

261
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,304
不，不，不...没有你我不能去
No, no, no... I can't go without you.

262
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,015
- 我不会...   - 你必须去！
- I won't-   - You have to!

263
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,643
在基辅你可以工作并把钱寄回来让我们有东西吃
In Kiev there's work for you and you can send back money so we can eat.

264
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,729
可离开了你，我...
To be away from you, I-

265
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,023
不，我...我会死的...
NO, I... I'll die...

266
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,942
只有妈妈好起来，我才能跟你在一起
It's just until Mother's better. Than I can be with you.

267
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,906
尤里！
Yuri!

268
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,660
基辅是你该去的地方
Kiev is where you belong.

269
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,504
我爱你
I love you.

270
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,222
这个你贴心佩戴
Wear it close to your heart.

271
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,120
我不认为我有那么帅
I don't think I'm that handsome.

272
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,164
你很有天赋
You have the gift.

273
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,832
谢谢
Thank you.

274
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,834
你这是去哪？
Where are you off to?

275
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,419
基辅
Kiev.

276
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,589
- 去工厂干活   - 用你这个特长？
- To work in a factory.   - With your talent?

277
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,968
- 我要为我的家尽责   - 我们都有各自的责任
- I have a duty to my family.   - We all have duties.

278
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,096
可你...你是个画家！
But you... are an artist!

279
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:35,602
何况你还有责任让全世界知道真相
And you have a duty to let the world know the truth,

280
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,146
尽你所能
an)' Way you can.

281
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:51,242
求你，求你...帮帮我！
Please, please... help me!

282
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:55,413
- 可怜可怜我吧，求你...   - 人渣！
- Have mercy on me, please...   - Scum!

283
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,291
- 她在讨饭吃   - 他们有食物
- She's begging for food.   - There is food.

284
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,793
有足够食物
Plenty of food.

285
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,672
党的路线就是：
That's the official party line:

286
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,257
没有饥荒！
No famine!

287
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,510
只是粮食短缺
Just a food shortage.

288
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:13,223
没有“饿死”这一说...而是，“普遍的营养不良”
No 'starvation'... instead, 'widespread malnutrition'.

289
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,268
我得在这儿跟你分手了
This is where I have to leave you.

290
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,492
- 你在做什么？停下来！   - 安静！
- What are you doing? Stop this!   - Be quiet.

291
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,578
你不能这么做
You can't do this.

292
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,874
- 你在散播西方的宣传   - 你不能这么做
- You are spreading western propaganda.   - You can't do this.

293
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,503
- 全世界都会听到的！   - 你跟我们来
- The whole world will hear this!   - You come with us.

294
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,179
把他抓起来...我们走！

295
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,940
但这是一个共同的行动来帮我们繁荣起来

296
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,194
我们来告知大家我们正在努力做什么

好吧，明早我们再聚

298
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,909
尼古拉！
Mykola!

299
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,952
他终于来了！
Finally he's here!

300
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,955
我听到的是一个卡契尼克族人的呼唤吗？
Did I hear the call of a Kachaniuk?

301
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,710
- 同志，这些是用来复印的，对吗？   - 干得不错
- Comrade, these are for copying, yes?   - Excellent work.

302
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,547
发生了什么？你都这么成熟了
What happened? You're so grown-up.

303
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,883
世界都已成熟。也有我们一份
The world grew up. We're just taking part.

304
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,760
是时候奋起直追了，年轻人
Time for a catch-up, young man.

305
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,637
喝一杯吧！上帝，真好！
A drink! God, yes!

306
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,351
不要让党听到你说“上帝”
Don't let the party hear you say 'God'.

307
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:03,351
尤里，娜塔奥卡怎么样了？
Yuri, how is Natalka?

308
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,520
别让尼古拉听到...
Don't let Mykola hear...

309
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:09,440
你还爱着她吗？甚至是你那次光荣地失败之后？
Are you still in love with her? Even after you were so gracious in defeat?

310
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,942
没错
I was.

311
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,780
就让它成为我悲伤的墓志铭吧，我曾光荣地失败
Let it be my sad epitaph, I was gracious in defeat.

312
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,033
我们正取得进展
We're making progress.

313
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,494
这个城市有很多希望
There's so much hope in the city.

314
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,205
我们正处在国家复兴的前沿
We're On the cusp of national renaissance.

315
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,708
- 变化实实在在产生了   - 是啊，但怎么产生的？
- Things are really changing.   - Yes, but how?

316
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,167
会带来什么？
To what end?

317
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,920
仅就我一天之内看到的...
The things I've seen in just one day...

318
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,881
有些事错得离谱
something is terribly wrong.

319
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,677
新生事物的成长都会伴随痛苦，理所当然
Every new system has its growing pains, of course.

320
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,723
- 这个冬天对收成不利   - 不，比那还糟
- The winter was bad for the harvest.   - No, it's worse than that.

321
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:46,227
苏联人在我们村里，逼着我们把农田集体化
There are Soviets in our village, forcing the collectivisation of our farms.

322
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,271
非常极端
Violently.

323
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,767
而我刚一到，就看到有人在挨饿
And just arriving, I have seen people starving,

324
00:35:51,797 --> 00:35:53,443
像垃圾一样自生自灭
left to rot like garbage.

325
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,612
我是说，你也从街上走过，肯定都看见了
I mean, you've walked the streets. You must have seen it.

326
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,115
现在是严重困难时期
There are severe hardships,

327
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,659
就像沙皇统治下一样
just as there were under the tsar.

328
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,537
我们现在有了属于自己的自由
We have our own freedom now,

329
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,873
继续前进的机会
an opportunity to push on,

330
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,669
重组社会，让人人享受公平待遇
to reorganise society so that everyone gets their fair share.

331
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,882
这是斯大林的真正理想
This is Stalin's true vision.

332
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:34,776
卡冈诺维奇...我没把你枪毙吗？
Kaganovich... haven't I had you shot?

333
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,323
不跟你的同志喝一杯吗？
Do you not drink with your comrades?

334
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,450
我带来了乌克兰的消息
I bring news from Ukraine.

335
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:47,580
我跟你说过镇压他们。为什么一次次让我失望
I told you to crush them. Why do you fail me over and over?

336
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,999
他们起义是因为饥饿
They rise up because they are starving.

337
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,508
我们的手段越残忍，他们就会反抗得更强烈
The more ruthless our methods, the more they resist.

338
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:53,711
这些该死的乌克兰人
Damn those Ukrainians.

339
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,801
把他们的粮食全拿走
Take all their food.

340
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,928
不光是粮食...所有东西！
Notjust the grain... everything!

341
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,515
关闭所有粮店和粮库
Close the food stores and banks.

342
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:09,602
把食品运走，关闭边境，把他们关在里面
Transport the food out. Close the borders. Keep them in.

343
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:13,731
一个也不许放
Do not let one of them leave.

344
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,796
别碰！
Leave it!

345
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,870
<i>亲爱的尤里</i>

00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,539
<i>我仰望明月思念着你</i>

<i>也请你这么做，知道我永远是你的</i>

371
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,003
作为一名艺术家，你必须找到真相
As an artist, you must find the truth,

372
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,630
而不是逃离它

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,507
该怎么做？
How?

374
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,012
用光
With light.

375
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,056
只有用光你才能找到真相

你有没有读过安德烈·布雷顿的《超现实主义宣言》？
Have you read Andre' Breton's 'Manifeste <i>du</i> surréalism' <i>?</i>

382
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,826
通过你的梦想

384
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,802
为什么，狄多？

385

我不想让你为了食物而堕落

387
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,568
我们每个人都会死去！
We're all going to die!

388
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,994
<i>我亲爱的，急切期待你的消息</i>

389
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,705
<i>几个星期没有来信让我担心到了极点</i>
<i>No letters for weeks makes me fear the worst.</i>

390
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:18,059
如果我们要接受审判，那就交给来自文明世界的成员
If we're going to be judged, then let us be judged by members of the civilised world,

391
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,353
而不是红色苏联帝国主义
and not by red Soviet imperialism,

392
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:25,024
交给那种斯大林不愿涉足的高级法院
to that higher court that Stalin never would want to be a part of.

393
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:31,030
乌克兰在文化方面有很多东西值得与欧洲其它国家分享

通过塔拉斯·舍甫琴科的文字
Inspired by the words of the great Taras Shevchenko,

398
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,222
通过第聂伯河的咆哮

399
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,766

<i>塔拉斯和我都为尼古拉感到骄傲</i>

<i>一种更黑暗，更沉重的氛围</i>

<i>对自由的丧失：会议，自由讨论...</i>

<i>甚至是旅行...一切都受到了限制</i>

这太可怕了！
It's hideous!

411
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,026
反动分子
Reactionary.

412
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,237
你必须描绘苏联振奋人心的形象！
You must paint uplifting images of the Soviet Union!

413
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,489
像是工厂和拖拉机？
Like factories and tractors?

414
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,449
你根本不是画家...
You are no artist...

415
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,369
- 你是国家的敌人！   - 铁木契克教授在哪？
- you are an enemy Of the state!   - Where is Professor Temchuk?

416
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,080
<i>我要求跟他讲话！</i>
<i>I demand to speak to him!</i>

417
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,166
那你就得去西伯利亚了

<i>所有自我表现和个人主义都被禁止</i>

419
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,848
<i>以迎合苏联那种套路</i>

420
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,185

421
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,689
<i>我被迫离开了学院</i>

422
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:31,442
<i>找了一份和拾荒者差不多的工作</i>

我不知道我的孩子们在哪

01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,928
继续前进！
Keep going!

586
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,727
保持阵型
Stay in formation.

587
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:18,065
我们不会给那些混蛋喘息的机会，不让他们重整队形
We'll give the bastards no breathing room, no chance to regroup.

588
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:40,921
冲啊，兄弟们！
Forward, brothers!

589
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:46,093
不！
No!

590
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,555
不！
No!

591
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:51,932
你这个傻瓜！
You fool!

592
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,582
尤里，醒醒！
Yuri, wake up!

593
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,043
我们得走了...马上！
We have to go... now!

594
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:51,343
请带上我
Please, take me with you.

595
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,138
我会带你上火车
I'll take you to the train.

596
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,391
求求你！你答应帮我的
Please! You promised to help me.

597
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,587
快点。火车尾巴处有一节货车箱
Come on. There's a boxcar at the end of the train.

598
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:43,020
我们在里面安全的
We'll be safe in here.

599
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:08,545
有谁能带我走？
Can somebody take me?

600
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,923
- 走开   - 求求你们...我的孩子！
- Get lost.   - Please... my child!

601
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:45,332
我们到了
We're here.

602
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:04,601
苏联窃贼！
Soviet thief!

603
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:11,692
尤金？
Yvgeny?

604
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:19,741
上卡车
Get in the truck.

605
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,410
马上
Now.

606
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,242
你知道你对我们的国家做了什么吗？
Do you know what you've done to our country?

607
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:06,079
- 尤里！   - 你们把一切都摧毁了
- Yuri!   - You have destroyed everything.

608
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:08,290
我当时属于红军
I was in the Red Army.

609
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:12,544
我知道乌克兰人正在挨饿，还有哈萨克人，白俄罗斯犹太人
I know Ukrainians are starving, Kazakhs, Byelorussian Jews.

610
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:14,963
但我是执行命令
But I was under orders.

611
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:16,298
- 命令？   - 尤里，别！
- Orders?   - Yuri, no!

612
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,175
靠边停下
Pull over.

613
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:22,304
出去
Get out.

614
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:29,353
这些粮食...
This grain...

615
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,022
这些够你们的人吃多久？
how long will it keep your people alive?

616
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:35,609
哪怕只能救下一条命，对我来说都够了
If I can save one life, that's enough for me.

617
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,238
尤里！
Yuri!

618
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,033
杀了他
Kill him.

619
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,118
他是苏联人
He's a Soviet.

620
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:47,204
他们正让我们所有人饿肚子
They're starving us all.

621
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,956
杀了他！
Kill him!

622
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:52,167
不！
No!

623
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,341
杀了他！
Kill him!

624
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:29,788
我怎么知道你不会出卖我们？
How do I know you won't turn us in?

625
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:38,005
我原本可以随时打死你们
I could have shot you at any time.

626
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:56,148
伏拉迪奥？
Vlodio?

627
01:18:58,025 --> 01:18:59,234
伏拉迪奥，是我啊
Vlodio, it's me.

628
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,446
尤里！
Yuri!

629
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:05,949
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

630
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:11,288
玛利亚呢？马可呢？孩子们呢？
Maria? Marko? The children?

631
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:18,879
对不起
I'm sorry.

632
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,966
伏拉迪奥，我有满满一卡车的粮食
Vlodio, I have a truck full of grain.

633
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:26,970
分给大家，然后到我家来
Feed the people. Then come to my home.

634
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,141
我家还在吗？
Is it still there?

635
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,790
你还活着！
You're alive!

636
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:39,292
感谢上帝！
Thank God!

637
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:44,673
- 原谅我   - 原谅什么？
- Forgive me.   - For what?

638
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:47,175
我离开得太久了
I have been gone too long.

639
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:55,642
- 让我看看你   - 对不起
- Let me look at you.   - Sorry.

640
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:58,562
你干嘛要说对不起？
What could you possibly be sorry for'?

641
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:04,484
尤里，我们的孩子没了
Yuri, I lost our baby.

642
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:19,624
我们有自己的奇迹
We have our own miracle.

643
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:24,337
罗科！
Lubko!

644
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:27,591
罗科！
Lubko!

645
01:21:38,351 --> 01:21:40,854
他是罗科，救了我一命
This is Lubko. He saved my life.

646
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,732
他失去了父母
He has no parents.

647
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,777
现在他有我们了
He has us now.

648
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,667
尤里...
Yuri...

649
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:17,807
妈妈？
Mama?

650
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,310
是我啊...尤里
It's me... Yuri.

651
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,276
试着吃一小片
Try to eat a little piece.

652
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:31,655
就一点
Just a little.

653
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:41,456
吃吧
Please.

654
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:45,085
- 这是什么？   - 汤
- What is it?   - Soup.

655
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:47,796
紫蓟和草煮的
Of thistle and grass.

656
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:55,387
上帝已经原谅了我们
God has forgiven us.

657
01:22:58,431 --> 01:23:00,267
他要原谅我们什么？
What could he possibly have to forgive us for?

658
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:05,313
尤里...
Yuri...

659
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:10,443
我用神像换的粮食
I traded the icon for food.

660
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,321
我不得不那么做
I had to.

661
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,574
本想救出你爷爷，但谢尔盖骗了我
To save your grandfather, but Sergei lied.

662
01:23:15,865 --> 01:23:17,409
他还把他关在监狱里
He still has him prisoner.

663
01:23:24,749 --> 01:23:26,334
没事的
It's okay.

664
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:46,479
我从小就一直在临摹圣尤里的神像
I have been painting icons of Saint Yuri since I was a child.

665
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:49,232
你拿去交换的...
What you traded...

666
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:52,360
只不过是其中之一
was merely one of them.

667
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,779
<i>这才是真正的神像</i>
<i>This is the real icon.</i>

668
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:12,255
妈妈...你看见没有？
Mama... you see?

669
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,717
上帝没有抛弃你
God has not forsaken you.

670
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,930
她安静地去了，和你父亲一道
She's at peace, with your father.

671
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,393
现在他们在一起了
She's with him now.

672
01:25:17,987 --> 01:25:20,073
你必须把它藏好
You must hide this.

673
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,536
我们现在是守护者了
We are the safe keepers now.

674
01:25:24,994 --> 01:25:26,788
- 我们准备带上它   - 去哪？
- We'll take it with us.   - Where?

675
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:31,501
我们要进入波兰，然后想办法去加拿大、美国
We'll cross into Poland and then make our way to Canada, America,

676
01:25:32,001 --> 01:25:35,838
在那里我们可以告诉全世界，斯大林正在对乌克兰人民做什么
where we can tell the world what Stalin is doing to the people of Ukraine.

677
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:38,341
但首先我要把我爷爷救出来
But first I must free my grandfather.

678
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,760
等等！
Wait!

679
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:45,724
我们还留着你爷爷的军刀
We still have your grandfather's sabre.

680
01:26:58,171 --> 01:26:59,881
快点！
Come on!

681
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,803

Dido!

682
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,434
我们今晚出发，去利沃夫
We're leaving tonight, for Lviv.

683
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:19,818
原谅我吧。我真是个老糊涂
Forgive me. I'm such an old fool.

684
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:31,621
迪米特里！
Dimitri!

685
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:34,207
狄多！
Dido!

686
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:45,718
开火！别让他们逃了！
Fire! Don't let them escape!

687
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,708
我杀了你只是个时间问题，老家伙
It's about time I killed you, old man.

688
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:37,270
来吧，杀了我！
GO ahead! Kill me!

689
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:40,940
我孙子会为我报仇的
My grandson will have his revenge.

690
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,860
那个画家？
The painter?

691
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,779
是战士！
The warrior!

692
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:44,981
我们会得到自由
We'll be free.

693
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:48,693
有农田，和更多的孩子
Have a farm, more children.

694
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:03,791
是那条河！我们到边境了
It's the river! We're at the border.

695
01:31:05,084 --> 01:31:07,003
我们马上就要进入波兰了
We'll soon be in Poland.

696
01:31:36,407 --> 01:31:37,825
快点！
Come on!

697
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:31,087
- 别管我，快走！   - 不，这次不行
- Go without me!   - NO, not this time.

698
01:32:31,462 --> 01:32:33,923
娜塔奥卡！快点！我们要在一起
Natalka! Come on! We'll be together.

699
